# ComfyUi-NoodleWebcam
Noodle webcam is a node that records frames and send them to your favourite node.

Currently you can only select the webcam, set the frame rate, set the duration and start/stop the stream (for continuous streaming TODO). 

As of now it is broken, because the preview doesn't return images, but it will be fixed soon
